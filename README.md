# Open_CV
Open CV is a a huge library for Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Image Processing. In this Project, I have done the code with python for image reading and processing.  there are some basic concepts like image reading, image transformations, contours etc. and some advanced concepts like Image spacing, image blurring, Bitwise operations, masking edge detections etc
